# OOP3200-Lab2
This lab was a collaboration between Daniel Hinbest and Ryan Clayson in Object-Oriented Programming II (OOP 3200) at Durham College. The assignment was to build off of Lab 1, where we take the work tickets and create class operators and data type conversions for the WorkTicket class.
